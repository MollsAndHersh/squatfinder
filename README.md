The simple and fast domain name permutation engine to detect similar domains caused by type squatting. (Still in progress) 

Typosquatting, also known as URL hijacking, is a form of cybersquatting (sitting on sites under someone else's brand or copyright) that targets Internet users who incorrectly type a website address into their web browser (e.g., “Gooogle.com” instead of “Google.com”)
